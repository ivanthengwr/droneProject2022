#### Progress report

Clean the unfinish drone where I have left off, unassembled the arduino board and took out the top of the drone cover to clean, resoldered a few connecters and cleaned up the dust to ready for the assembly of the ardupilot 

#### Things that needs to be done

- Figure out how to connect the 4 ESCs to the ardupilot
- Connect the receiver of the FrySky to the ardupilot to allow telemetry between the receiver and transmitter of the FrySky controller
